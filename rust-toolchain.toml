# Rust toolchain configuration for FLM
#
# This project requires nightly Rust for edition 2024 support.
# Some crates (e.g., home/base64ct) require edition 2024, which is only available in nightly.
#
# To use this toolchain:
#   rustup toolchain install nightly
#   cargo +nightly build
#
# Or set nightly as default:
#   rustup default nightly
#
[toolchain]
channel = "nightly"
components = ["rustfmt", "clippy"]
targets = []

# Note: Once edition 2024 lands on stable, we can switch back to stable
# and remove the home crate pin if applicable.
